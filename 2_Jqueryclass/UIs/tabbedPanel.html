            <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be
                played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and
                "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard
                or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the
                shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.</p>

            <p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played with a spherical
                ball between two teams of eleven players. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and
                dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called
                a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by moving the ball beyond the goal
                line into the opposing goal.</p>
